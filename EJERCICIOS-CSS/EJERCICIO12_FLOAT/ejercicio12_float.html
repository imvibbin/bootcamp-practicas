            Guernica (Spanish: [ɡeɾˈnika]; Basque: [ɡernika]) is a large
            1937 oil
            painting by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso.[1][2] It is one of his best-known works, regarded by many art
            critics as the most moving and powerful anti-war painting in history.[3] It is exhibited in the Museo Reina
            Sofía in Madrid.[4]
            The grey, black, and white painting, on a canvas 3.49 meters (11 ft 5 in) tall and 7.76 meters (25 ft 6 in)
            across, portrays the suffering wrought by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored
            horse, a bull, screaming women, a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames.
            Picasso painted Guernica at his home in Paris in response to the 26 April 1937 bombing of Guernica, a Basque
            Country town in northern Spain that was bombed by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy at the request of the
            Spanish Nationalists. Upon completion, Guernica was exhibited at the Spanish display at the 1937 Paris
            International Exposition, and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to
            raise funds for Spanish war relief.[5] The painting soon became famous and widely acclaimed, and it helped
            bring worldwide attention to the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War.
